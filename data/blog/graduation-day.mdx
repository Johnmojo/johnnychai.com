Looking at graduation as a rite of passage, it can be seen as accomplishment, excitement, and pride. When my ceremony was canceled abruptly in March of 2020, I was told it will proceed instead to October of 2020, eventual postponement leads to another postponement, then finally settled on the 1st of April 2022.

The graduation ceremony was held on Friday morning at the Pullman Kuching. Everyone was asked to conduct a self-test beforehand. It was a quick one, we got our scrolls and took some photos. I am grateful for the measures that schools and states have taken to ensure the safety of students and others. Overall, not too bad!

Of course, this is possibly the worst time to graduate. Lots of uncertainty. Everyone has been talking about what our career prospects will look like. With the global economy set to experience the deepest recession since World War Two, _what could possibly go wrong?_
