# Story

In the beginning, Kilau went on a hunting trip deep inside the forest and saw a chirping bird and an Orangutan sprinting. Kilau noticed the Orangutan was chased by a fellow Iban-man with a spear. Kilau immediately intervenes and explains not to hunt for defenseless Orangutans. The Orangutan made it away into the deep forest.
\
\
After the dream last night, he went out to look for the god-bird. He found the bird god and the bird god promises to assist him in helping the Orangutans. Ruai noticed at curious Kilau and asked for his assistance – find Lia Jenerang (red ginger).
\
\
Once Kilau came back, Ruai teaches him how to rub red ginger and perform pressure-aided delivery to a pregnant female. Surprised Kilau thanked Ruai and went back to plant it near the longhouse (Since then, the Iban people learned how to perform pressure-aided delivery and usage of ginger for childbirth).
\
\
Ruai is fishing at the river. However, Kilau sees a mesmerizing way of Ruai catching fish using something to poison the river to get the fish out from it. Ruai explained to Kilau what he used and asked Kilau to collect the Tubai so he could show him more. After Kilau finishes collecting the Tubai, Ruai shows him how to use the Tubai to catch the fish (From there, the Iban people planted Tubai near the longhouse and use it to get the fish).
\
\
Again, Kilau had a dream about the bird god. The bird god transforms into a human-like form and summons Kilau to his sky realm. Sengalang then explains Kilau should teach the knowledge back to the people and spread the stories and taboos of Orangutans to the future generation.

# Character

In the game, there are 5 characters. We sketch out the character ideas and later model them in AutoDesk Maya and finally the animation rig.
\
\
**• Sengalang Burong – Eldest siblings among 7 deities and known as God of War. He is a messenger to god and humans.**
\
\
**• Kilau – A young Iban hunter who wants to protect the Orangutan.**
\
\
**• Ruai – The chief of orangutans. (Bunsu Mayas)**
\
\
**• Wild Boar – Hostile wild boar that roams the forest. Can only perform a melee attack.**
\
\
**• Hunter – The enemy that wants to hunt the Orangutan. Hunter will use Sumpit (blowpipe) to attack the player.**

# Usability Testing

![](/static/images/works/maias/maias-13.png)

During our short **Level UP 2019 trip in Kuala Lumpur**, we’re exposed to the industry and were able to see how these people work. We also had an opportunity to do a quick user testing.
\
\
Although our game isn’t finished and is still in the early stages, we managed to get around 33 verbal feedback at the event. With the data gathered, we quickly compiled everything into a simple infographic chart.
\
\
We faced some difficulties too while working on the project. No prior experience with C# complicated our issue, even more, other the assignment are taking our time and information regarding folklores of Orang Utan are difficult to obtain, therefore we met with a representative from WCS Sarawak to share their info and aid us in our project.
\
\
In the end, having a game that retells folklore stories of Orangutans while promoting their habitat can tell a good story. Perhaps they certainly cannot do everything at once. We believe retelling folktales stories of Orangutans will spark their attention to the endangered status species.
