# Story writing in a tiny platform

This project demonstrates how a user can sign up for an account, then log into the system with the user's database - write stories, notes, and update and delete when necessary.

# Challenge

The most challenging technical aspect for this project, learning how to prevent SQL injection, using PDO with prepared statements rather than MySQL (deprecated) or mysqli. The latter seems to be better with security, lightweight, and much cross-database compatible.
