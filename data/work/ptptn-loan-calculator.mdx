# How does it work?

Each value are stored respectively in each `State` Hook. (I was using React functional components).

![](/static/images/works/ptptn-calculator/ptptn-calculator-1.png)

```javascript
// Give me 20 years, please
const [rawPeriodValue, setPeriodValue] = useState(20);
```

The value is then fed by the input fields we have over here ONLY if they are changes made in the field.

```javascript
<input
  onChange={(e) => setPeriodValue(e.target.value)}
  value={rawPeriodValue}
  type="number"
/>
```

After we got all the values, we can start comparing and doing multiplication with values stored in the `State`. Like trying to find out how many months in a year. In turn, final values should be re-rendered on state changed.

```javascript
<span>
  // 240 months
  {rawPeriodValue * 12} Months
</span>
```

# **What I learned**

Overall, I’ve used `useRef` to manipulate DOM (as the way React intended), passing `props` as function, to toggle state from the other component (Help section). Also, a very brief design for this relatively quick application job.
