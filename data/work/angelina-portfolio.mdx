# The Client

Angelina is a poet and visual artist from Sarawak, Malaysia. She is a talented artist and looking into ways to showcase her work - ranging from poets, visual arts, and workshops. She also looking into ways to sell her work online.

# Challenge

We have quite a few artwork portfolio entries and each of the entries should be linked conveniently to the storefront for purchase. We also have to set up some shipping rules (e.g. free shipping for Sarawak and Sabah but not West Malaysia depending on the volume).

# Solution

For this project, I worked with my friend - <a className="underline" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/laurence-lee-9b1931251">Laurence Lee</a> who designed the website while I coded the custom theme.
We also looked into Shopify and Magento but ultimately decided on WooCommerce since it works nicely with WordPress and is very customizable.

# What I learned

Integrating with WooCommerce is not as easy as it seems. There are a lot of things to consider like setting up payments gateway, geo-restriction / shipping rules, and so on. WooCommerce is not sufficient for a full-fledged eCommerce site and may require some paying 3rd party plugin to complement it. To keep everything simple, we used Sass for styling and some other plugins like contact form.
