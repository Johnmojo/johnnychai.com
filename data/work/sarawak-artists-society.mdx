# The client

The Sarawak Artists Society was looking for ways to digitize their work online. They are looking into ways to promote and establish an online presence.

# Challenge

We have a large number of uncompressed artworks is to be cataloged and categorized to each respective profile. The data needed to be editable based on the post types.

# Solution

My role primarily was to design & create a functional WordPress custom theme. The project used vanilla Javascript and SASS. To handle the large data collection, we used Google Forms to collect each member's artwork and information (50+ members ~ 300+ artworks). Moreover, post-processing of the artworks is done using imagemagick CLI and Adobe Lightroom to batch watermark.

Finally, the main page features two latest news and four random artworks. Each profile (artists) has their own individual summary bio page and works linked to their page.

# **What I learned**

I have used custom taxonomies / CPT, sorting using WordPress tag, handling & querying hundreds of artworks entries without depending on plugins. I was also able to have more hands-on experience with PHP directly.
